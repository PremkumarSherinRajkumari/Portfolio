Welcome to my Photography Portfolio! This single-page application showcases a selection of my photography work across various genres. It is built using React and demonstrates a range of skills including complex UI components, form validation, and responsive design.

## Features

#Views

The application includes the following views:

1. Home - An introduction to my photography style and recent projects.
2. Work - A detailed description of my background.
3. Projects - A showcase of my photography organized by categories.
4. Contact - A form for users to reach out for inquiries or bookings.

## Technologies Used

- React
- JavaScript
- CSS (with BEM methodology)
- React Router

## Requirements

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Basic understanding of React and web development concepts

### Complex UI Elements

The site features the following complex UI components:

- Accordion in the Gallery view for filtering categories.
- Modal for viewing images in detail when clicked in the Gallery.
- Interactive Form in the Contact view, including validation for required fields.

### Loading Indicator

A loading spinner is displayed when the images are being fetched from the server in the Gallery view. It is located within a section with ARIA role "status" to inform users about the loading state.

### Adaptive Design

The site is responsive and has been optimized for viewing on devices down to 360px width. The CSS follows a mobile-first approach, ensuring a smooth experience on all screen sizes.
